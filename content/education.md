## The group is responsible for the following courses at Uppsala University:

- [Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics with Sequence Analysis, 7.5 credits](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kpid=33382&type=1)<br>
  This campus course is given as part of the Masters program in
  Pharmaceutical Modeling at Uppsala University and contains the
  representation of biological and chemical data in computers, introduction
  to biological and chemical databases, theory and methods for analysis of
  experimental data, predictive modeling and validation, structure-activity
  relationships, and basic sequence analysis including data from
  next-generation sequencing.

- [Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics, 7.5 credits](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kpid=19956&lasar=16%2F17&typ=1)<br>
  This introductory internet-based course aims to provide basic knowledge of
  how bioinformatics tools can be used to solve problems within pharmacology,
  pharmacy, and pharmaceutical chemistry.

- [Applied Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics, 5 credits](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kpid=28687&lasar=16%2F17&typ=1)<br>
  This internet-based course is a continuation of the Pharmaceutical
  Bioinformatics course with focus on practical applications and a
  continuation of how to use predictive statistical modelling methods,
  primarily directed to applications in the pharmaceutical field.

- [Applied Pharmaceutical Structural Bioinformatics, 5 credits](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kpid=28688&lasar=16%2F17&typ=1)<br>
  This internet-based course includes solving practical problems in
  pharmacology, life sciences and bioinformatics using free software and
  databases relating to the structure of functional proteins and drug
  targets.


## The group is also involved in teaching on the following courses at Uppsala University:

- [Pharmaceutical Molecular Biology with Bioinformatics](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=3FB012)<br>
  This is a campus course on the Master of Science Programme in Pharmacy that
  contains an introduction to molecular biology with a focus on
  pharmaceutical science. Our group is responsible for the Bioinformatics
  part.

- [Introduction to Programming in Python and R for Bioscience](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=3FB617)<br>
  This campus course on the Masters program in Pharmaceutical Modeling at
  Uppsala University is an introductory course to programming in Python and
  R. Our group is responsible for the Python part of the course.

- [Molecular Biology with Focus on Drug Therapy](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=3FB013)<br>
  This campus course on the Bachelor of Science Programme presents an
  introduction to molecular biology. Our group is responsible for an
  introductory bioinformatics part of the course.

- [Large Datasets for Scientific Applications](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=1TD267)<br>
  This course is given at the Department of Information Technology, and
  comprises how to develop scientific applications utilizing methods and key
  concepts of large scale data processing platforms. Our group is responsible
  for the Big Data in Genomics lecture and the Apache Spark part of the
  course.
