abstract = "Increasing size of datasets is challenging for machine learning, and Big Data frameworks, such as Apache Spark, have shown promise for facilitating model building on distributed resources. Conformal prediction is a mathematical framework that allows to assign valid confidence levels to object-specific predictions. This contrasts to current best-practices where the overall confidence level for predictions on unseen objects is estimated based on previous performance, assuming exchangeability. Here we report a Spark-based distributed implementation of conformal prediction, which introduces valid confidence estimation in predictive modeling for Big Data analytics. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets show the validity and the scalabilty of the method, which is freely available as open source. \u00a9 2015 ACM."
