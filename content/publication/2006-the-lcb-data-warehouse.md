abstract = "The Linnaeus Centre for Bioinformatics Data Warehouse (LCB-DWH) is a web-based infrastructure for reliable and secure microarray gene expression data management and analysis that provides an online service for the scientific community. The LCB-DWH is an effort towards a complete system for storage (using the BASE system), analysis and publication of microarray data. Important features of the system include: access to established methods within R/Bioconductor for data analysis, built-in connection to the Gene Ontology database and a scripting facility for automatic recording and re-play of all the steps of the analysis. The service is up and running on a high performance server. At present there are more than 150 registered users. AVAILABILITY: An open functional version is available at https://dw.lcb.uu.se/index.phtml?i_login=test. User accounts are created upon request. Additional facilities including plug-ins, user documentation and a password protected data storage system are available from http://www.lcb.uu.se/lcbdw.php"
