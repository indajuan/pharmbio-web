abstract = "We present a method for interpretation of conformal prediction models. The discrete gradient of the largest p-value is calculated with respect to object space. A criterion is applied to identify the most important component of the gradient and the corresponding part of the object is visualized. The method is exemplified with data from drug discovery relating chemical compounds to mutagenicity. Furthermore, a comparison is made to already established important subgraphs with respect to mutagenicity and this initial assessment shows very useful results with respect to interpretation of a conformal predictor.
