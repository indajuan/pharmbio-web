long_bio = "I obtained my first PhD in marine biology in 2006 studying the population dynamics of grey seals. Between 2006-2016 I undertook several research projects modelling wildlife populations and analysing trends in biodiversity. With a desire to broaden my scientific horizons in 2017 I began studies for a second PhD in pharmaceutical science. For this PhD I shall develop machine learning methods for online, large-scale analysis of microscopy image data as part of the [HASTE](http://haste.research.it.uu.se/) project."
