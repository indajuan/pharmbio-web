abstract = "Microservices have emerged as a modern interpretation of service-oriented architectures where processes are small and communicate over a network using lightweight protocols to fulfill a goal. In this talk I will present our work on microservices, and how they can be used to empower interoperable and scalable analysis services and pipelines in virtual infrastructures on cloud computing resources. I will also give examples and experiences from the PhenoMeNal H2020 project where a developer community in metabolomics is moving to such architecture."
