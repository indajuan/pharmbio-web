abstract = "Today we have access to high-throughput technologies to study biological phenomena. This presents new challenges to data management and analysis, including  storage, analysis methods, pipelines, scaling, automation, data integration, and security. Cloud computing and Microservices has emerged as an interesting option to achieve a scalable and agile environment. This presentation presents microservices and virtual research environments (VREs) and exemplify with the developments of the EU H2020 project PhenoMeNal."
