The SeRC flagship project e-Science for Cancer Prevention and Control (eCPC) will set up a modular system for prediction of cancer initiation and progression. It will be based on computational models that integrate data from different sources, including molecular (e.g. genomic, proteomic), environmental and life-style factors. By superimposing screening and prevention strategies on the models, reduced over-treatment, morbidity, mortality and cost can be quantified.

Ola Spjuth leads WP1 (data management and integration) and is also member of the management group.
