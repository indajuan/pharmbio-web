OpenRiskNet is a 3-year EU Horizon 2020 project starting on December 1st 2016 that will develop and deploy an integrated, secure, permanent, service driven and sustainable infrastructure for data managing, data sharing, processing, analysis, information mining and modelling as well as workflow development and sharing, visualisation and reporting to serve communities in the areas of toxicology, risk assessment and chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and nanomaterial product development including safe-bydesign aspects at an early stage. This e-infrastructure will support all aspects of risk assessment mentioned above by allowing for the integration of all toxicology足related data sources, for the implementation and execution of processing and analysis pipelines.

OpenRiskNet will address the challenges arising from the fragmentation of the data and the insufficient harmonization of user guidance by creating application programming interfaces (APIs) including technical and semantic interoperability layers, containerizing the databases and computational tools, and integrating the micro足services into virtual environments (VEs) allowing for deployment of personal and multi足tenant instances of this flexible, secure and high足performance e-infrastructure.

Ola Spjuth leads WP2: "Interoperability, Deployment and Security".
