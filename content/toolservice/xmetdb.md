XMetDB is an open access database for drugs and other xenobiotics and their
respective metabolites. The database contains chemical structures of xenobiotic
biotransformations with substrate atoms annotated as reaction centra, the
resulting product formed, and the catalyzing enzyme, type of experiment, and
literature references.

Associated with the database is a web interface for the submission and
retrieval of experimental metabolite data for drugs and other xenobiotics in
various formats, and a web API for programmatic access is also available.  The
database is open for data deposition, and a curation scheme is in place for
quality control.

[An extensive guide](http://pharmb.io/publication/2016-xmetdb-an-open-access-database-for-xenobiotic-metabolism/)
on how to enter experimental data into is available from the [XMetDB wiki](http://www.xmetdb.org/wiki/).
XMetDB formalizes how biotransformation data should be reported, and the openly
available systematically labeled data is a big step forward towards better
models for predictive metabolism.
