Using KubeNow you can rapidly deploy, scale, and tear down your Kubernetes clusters on any cloud.

Rather than providing an all-in-one tool for provisioning a Kubernetes cluster
(e.g. Juju and Kubespray), KubeNow comes as a thin layer on top of Terraform,
Packer, Ansible and kubeadm. Following this approach we aim to provide a
simple, light-weight, tool for Kubernetes provisioning, while making DevOps
transparent and fun.
