**Welcome to the Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics research group, lead by
Assoc. Prof. Ola Spjuth**

Find below a short introduction to the group's main field of study:

Data-intensive and translational bioinformatics
-----------------------------------------------

High-throughput technologies have transformed biomedicine into a
data-intensive discipline. This has shifted the focus from traditional
data generation and hypothesis testing to more data-driven research, and
bioinformatics data analysis has become the bottleneck in many projects.
However, the field is characterized by growing data sets and poorly
scalable software, threatening to severely constrain many biomedical
projects. Our group aims at developing new methods and applications to
meet the demands of high-throughput biology and drug discovery, using
high-throughput e-infrastructures and Big Data analytics frameworks,
aiming towards “next-generation bioinformatics”.

to allow for scalable analysis and to cope with the data deluge.
