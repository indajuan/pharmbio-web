On 25-26 Sept 2017 our group organized a workshop on microservices development with a large focus on [Kubernetes](kubernetes.io)/[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) and how we can establish a CICD system within the [OpenRiskNet](https://openrisknet.org/) project. The meeting was attended by 16 people from 8 European partners. A large focus was discussions on how we can develop interoperable services with semantic APIs, and there were also practical hands-on sessions on our [OpenShift recipes](https://github.com/OpenRiskNet/home/tree/master/openshift).
