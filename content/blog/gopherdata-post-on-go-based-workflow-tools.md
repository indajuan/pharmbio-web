[Samuel](https://pharmb.io/people/saml) and
[Jon](https://pharmb.io/people/jon/) from the group contributed to [a post](http://gopherdata.io/post/more_go_based_workflow_tools_in_bioinformatics/)
on the [GopherData website](http://gopherdata.io/) together with [Daniel Whitenack](https://twitter.com/dwhitena)
from the [Pachyderm](http://pachyderm.io/) team, providing a brief overview of the
growing ecosystem of workflow tools in bio- and cheminformatics implemented in
the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).

The group is doing research in workflows, including how the [Pachyderm data framework](http://pachyderm.io/)
can be used to coordinate workflows on [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
clusters (Jon) (Kubernetes is Google's open source container orchestration
framework), as well as developing our own light-weight system,
[SciPipe](https://scipipe.org), which focuses on complex, dynamic workflows,
where dynamic (or on-line) scheduling is
important. 

Thus, as the ecosystem of Go-based workflow tools in bioinformatics recently
grew even more, with the addition of the Reflow framework, released as open
source by life science startup Grail Inc., we found it worthwhile to provide a
brief overview of the growing ecosystem of tools, to help users navigate the
different options, and find which tool or framework might best fit one's needs.
