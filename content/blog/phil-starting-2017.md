We welcome Phil Harrison as new PhD Student in our group. Phil obtained his first PhD in marine biology in 2006 studying the population dynamics of grey seals. Between 2006-2016 he undertook several research projects modelling wildlife populations and analysing trends in biodiversity. Phil joined our group and will develop machine learning methods for online, large-scale analysis of microscopy image data as part of the ["HASTE"](http://haste.research.it.uu.se/) project.
