title = "THE 6TH SYMPOSIUM ON CONFORMAL AND PROBABILISTIC PREDICTION WITH APPLICATIONS (COPA 2017)"
+++

14-16 June, 2017, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

Ola Spjuth is local organizer of the event with the conference website: ["http://clrc.rhul.ac.uk/copa2017/"](http://clrc.rhul.ac.uk/copa2017/)

Symposium Theme:
Quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions produced by classification and regression techniques is an important problem in the field of Machine Learning. Conformal Prediction is a framework for complementing the predictions of Machine Learning algorithms with reliable measures of confidence. The methods developed based on this framework produce well-calibrated confidence measures for individual examples without assuming anything more than that the data are generated independently by the same probability distribution (i.i.d.). The aim of this symposium is to serve as a forum for the presentation of new and ongoing work and the exchange of ideas between researchers on any aspect of Conformal Prediction and its applications.
