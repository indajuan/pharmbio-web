## Abstract

The life sciences is transforming into a data-intensive discipline with high
demands on e-infrastructure. Cloud computing has opened up new avenues for
getting access to compute resources, but also for provisioning and integrating
geographically distributed data, and complying with the FAIR principles that
data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. In this
presentation I will cover the ongoing work and strategies at ["Science for Life Laboratory"](http://www.scilifelab.se)
for taking advantage of cloud resources in data-intensive bioinformatics, and
also describe some of the ongoing work in my research group on
microservices, scientific workflows, and Apache Spark to deliver scalable
virtual research environments within the European cloud-based
e-infrastructure landscape, promoting collaborative and reproducible
science.
