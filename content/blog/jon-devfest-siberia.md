[Jon Ander Novella](https://pharmb.io/people/jon/) will present at [DevFest Siberia 2017](https://gdg-siberia.com/), on the topic of "Scalable and reproducible bioinformatics workflows with Pachyderm".

## Abstract

Computational biology is complex not only because of the increasing amounts of
data. Additionally, biologists must manage analyses that encompass multiple
stages and a great number of tools, all the while maintaining reproducibility
of results.

Amongst the variety of available tools to undertake parallel computations,
[Pachyderm](http://pachyderm.io) is an open-source workflow-engine and
distributed data processing tool that leverages the container ecosystem.

In our study we aimed to enable a scalable and reproducible metabolomics
workflow using Pachyderm. To achieve this goal, we deployed it on our
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster running on Openstack backed by a
[Minio](http://minio.io/) object store and GlusterFS. After testing the
solution in the [Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing cloud](http://cloud.snic.se/),
we showed that it scales well and that it is a great alternative for
bioinformatics analyses.
