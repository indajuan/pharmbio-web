Jon Ander Novella will present at DevFest Siberia 2017: ["Scalable and reproducible bioinformatics workflows with Pachyderm"](https://gdg-siberia.com/)

Abstract:
Computational biology is complex not only because of the increasing amounts of data. Additionally, biologists must manage analyses that encompass multiple stages and a great number of tools, all the while maintaining reproducibility of results.

Amongst the variety of available tools to undertake parallel computations, Pachyderm is an open-source workflow-engine and distributed data processing tool that leverages the container ecosystem.

In our study we aimed to enable a scalable and reproducible metabolomics workflow using Pachyderm. To achieve this goal, we deployed it on our Kubernetes cluster running on Openstack backed by a Minio object store and GlusterFS. After testing the solution in the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing cloud, we showed that it scales well and that it is a great alternative for bioinformatics analyses.
