Our research group will contribute to the [Glenna2](https://neic.no/glenna2/) project, an activity within the [Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)](https://neic.no). We will contribute with experiences and use cases from the [PhenoMeNal-H2020](http://phenomenal-h2020.eu) project, and the focus is on making the [PhenoMeNal Cloud Research Environment (CRE)](https://portal.phenomenal-h2020.eu/cloud-research-environment) available on the nordic clouds, and work on features such as data and compute federation capabilities.
