MetaPrint2D is a tool that predicts xenobiotic metabolism through data-mining
and statistical analysis of known metabolic transformations reported in
scientific literature.

Two versions are available: MetaPrint2D, which predicts sites of phase I
metabolism, defined as the addition of oxygen (e.g. hydroxylation, oxidation,
epoxidation) or elimination reactions, and MetaPrint2D-React which can make
predictions concerning a wider range of reactions, and is able to predict the
types of transformation that can take place at ease site of metabolism, and the
likely metabolite formed.
