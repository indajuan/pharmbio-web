A Flow-based Programming (FBP) micro-framework for Go (Golang).

The aim of FlowBase, as opposed to being a full-blown framework, is to provide
just enough functionality on top of the existing FBP-like primives in Golang
(channels with bounded buffers, asynchronous go-routines), to enable developing
data processing applications with it. Thus the term "FBP micro-framework".
