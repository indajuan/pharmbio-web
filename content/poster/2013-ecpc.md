title = "e-Science for Cancer Prevention and Control (eCPC) - a flagship project for the Swedish e-Science Research Centre"
abstract = "The SeRC flagship project e-Science for Cancer Prevention and Control (eCPC) aims to use e-Science methods and technologies to answer the research question: How can we model individual variation in cancer risk to develop better cancer prevention and control strategies? Individual variation may be measured by different biomarkers or environmental exposures, and prevention and control strategies include screening and vaccination. eCPC will use data integration, system biology, machine learning and simulation to address the above research question and suggest improved risk prediction and optimal cancer screening programmes."
